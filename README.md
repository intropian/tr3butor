# Welcome to tr3butor

tr3butor is the go to platform for pioneering web3 talent to connect with the world's most exciting DAOs to shape the next stage in the evolution of the of the world wide web.

## The Mission

As a team We want to ensure that every DAO has access to the best talent capable of taking their work to the next level. tr3butor is the stomping ground where the two come together to do epic work for the next era of the web. 

Our aim is to become the go to platform for DAOs looking for knowledge, talent, and the support and backing of this community. 

We will aim:

1. Educate & entertain both DAOs and tr3butors through content & events
2. Make users stick through advanced earning and staking strategies for both parties

## Problem

The most frequently mentioned problem for DAOs is recruiting. There is a small supply of star talent with the skillset needed by most DAOs and the competition is significant. Finding those brave enough to work on something completely new, bound by uncertainty, and be brilliant enough to light the way forward. 

## Pain
    - When you ask DAO leads and operators what's their the biggest pain point, 9/10 will answer – talent. Hiring, onboarding, retaining. The talent suffer, too. We are navigating in the darkness looking for opportunities, professional growth, education, community. We need each other, and we have to build a place where we can meet, learn, educate, build, contribute and just have fun, don't we?
    
## Who are we building tr3butor for?
    - As tr3butor is а next-level marketplace, our audience consists of top DAOs that join us to find contributors that can help them meet their project's ambitious goals.
    - Given the diversity of talent in tr3butor's community, any DAO will find it valuable to participate in tr3butor's growing and active community. Whether you're here because of unmet hiring needs, governance processes or simply seeking the best practices, for hiring, managing payments and grant distributions, we believe you'll find what you're looking for.
  
    
## Our Solution - The community, the platform, the DAO.

*Our very first (hackathon) features DAOs & their quests explorer page where users will find contributor application forms for DAOs. A simple yet effective authorisation process is in place, and our Discord channe offers addditoin support in the form of onboarding, education and invaluable resources to connect with peeers and grow your skills*

 In a few weeks we'll launch advanced contributor profiles, that will serve as on-chain CVs, custom feed of quests based on their followings and skills, and on-site blog platform to build the all-inclusive library of professional content from DAOs and contributors.
 
  Next stage of the project development will be adding in-app messaging and project-management tools & integrating advanced payment system for DAOs to have a single-interface solution for recurrent payments, bounties and tips. 
  
  On top of that we can build (or integrate) many really exciting things, but for now we don't want to guess which of them our DAO and community will prioritise in roadmap and what else someone can bring on the table.
